# Problem
[![Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-1D63ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://forums.docker.com/t/i-cant-deploy-ofcial-ubuntu-squid-via-docker-compose/142636)

OP wanted to get the default configuration files generated by the image into their host machine, to be able to modify and mount them for override

# Solution
At first, I offered to execute: `docker run --rm -v ./etc/squid:/host ubuntu/squid:5.2-22.04_beta cp -r /etc/squid /host`<br>
After trying it myself, I saw the command was failing due to the image's entrypoint

Therefore, and due to OP requesting the command in a compose file, the [init compose](./compose.init.yml) was created, overriding the entrypoint with the command to copy the default configurations

After some thinking. I added the best course of action would probably be to run
```sh
docker run -d --name copy-conf ubuntu/squid:5.2-22.04_beta
docker cp copy-conf:/etc/squid ./etc/squid
```

> Also suggested mount path should be changed from `./etc` to `./etc/squid` to match container path `/etc/squid`
